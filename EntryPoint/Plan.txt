Mechanics
	Paths
		Mana
			Finite quantity, regenerates quickly
			Used to draw paths 

		Effects
			Accelerate
				Only affects player
				Positive Acceleration

			Cut
				Affects world and some enemies

			Bouncing
				Affects world and all enemies

	Health
		Stunned for X seconds when "hit"
			Knocked back
			Still behaves kinematically
			Cannot follow paths
			Cannot be hit while stunned

		Stunning should be sufficient penalty/risk of failure

		Death from falling below edge of map
			Or for edge of map rising above you!
			Restart level/from last checkpoint

	Enemies
		Block with paths

		Swipe
	
Game 
	Tutorial
		Individual, single-screen maps. Suitable as a tutorial for the player
		to get used to the basic mechanics of the game

		Moving
		Cutting
		Bouncing
		Physics and Weights
		Momentum

	Puzzles
		Large maps which are not meant to be solved under time constraints, but
		require creative use of cuts and physics to complete.

		Lever/Counterweight
		Flowing Balls
		Ricochet

	Race
		High speed sidescrolling action, with the goal of traversing the map as
		quickly as possible

		Icebergs
			Icebergs sink when you sit on them
			Water below doesn't kill but slows you down when you drop in

		Underwater
			Floating upwards!
			Much greater viscosity

		Cave
			Lots of vertical impediments
			Both roof and floor

	Climber
		Equivalent to "story" mode

		"infinite" climbing

		Seamless save/check-points along the way

		Varying styles of map along the way

		House
			Things are regular, blocky, square and neatly arranged. 

		Roofing
			A maze of piping and wires and all that. Lots and lots of 
			moving parts since this is what keeps the ventilation of the
			house running.

		Wall
			The outside of the house next to a brick wall; all bodies of 
			interest are attached to the solid wall on one side of the 
			screen, while the other side is open space.

		Trees
			Lots of branches and leaves, forming a maze that the player has
			to navigate.

		Sky
			Sparsely occupied, primarily jumping from cloud to cloud using 
			air currents to give you a boost. Occasional balloons or air
			planes to spice things up

		Space
			Mostly jumping from satellites and meteors; have to make heavy 
			use of bouncing to prevent things from knocking you out of 
			their way

		Cinematics
			Opening 
				Crashing through all these scenes in reverse order, ending up 
				at the start location

			Closing
				Reaching the original height (end location) and becoming a 
				star again
